# Within
- Within was my first game i made with Unity after weeks of learning how to use the engine and program with C#.
- It is based upon the idea of the backrooms as that seemed like a simple approach to try out.
- This was made as a school assignement in which i had 7 weeks to work upon (including learning C# and how to use the Unity engine from the ground up). As such, many concepts i wished to integrate couldn't be done.

## Controls

*None of the audio is my own, it was made by Arkadiusz Reikowski and Underworld respectively.*
