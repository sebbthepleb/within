# Within
- I tried learning Unity and C# and it failed miserably.
- Based upon the idea of the backrooms as that seemed like a simple approach to try out.

## Controls
- WASD to move.
- Mouse to look.
- Esc to pause.
- Door to leave.

*None of the audio is my own, it was made by Arkadiusz Reikowski and Underworld respectively.*
