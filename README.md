# Within
- Within was my first game i made with Unity after weeks of learning how to use the engine and program with C#.
- It is based upon the idea of the backrooms as that seemed like a simple approach to try out.

## Controls
- WASD to move.
- Mouse to look.
- Esc to pause.
- Door to leave...

*None of the audio is my own, it was made by Arkadiusz Reikowski and Underworld respectively.*
